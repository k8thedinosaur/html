    <p>Murray was adopted from the Oregon Humane Society in 2010. Her whereabouts before that time are unknown, but she has followed Human Kate around to many different apartments in Portland since (due to Human Kate being a fairly reliable food-getter, poo-remover, and toy-thrower).</p>

    <p>Murray's favorite page on the internet is all about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider">spiders</a>, and she loves it due to the ridiculous amount of delicious things it contains which she would very much like to stalk and eat if they weren't just pictures on a screen. This is a cause of great vexation for her.</p>

    <p>Another great struggle in her life is the conundrum of the dead-or-alive toy. Murray is a great hunter and killer of all small, moving things, be they jingle-balls, stuffy mice, or feather-on-a-string-on-a-stick...s. She has killed all of these toys dead countless times, but upon discovering their buried (in blankets) corpses later, she often finds that they have come alive again and must be murdered repeatedly. When this happens, she will drag them out and carry them around the apartment, repeatedly uttering her battle cry of <span style="border: 1px solid #173b80"><b>"Ryeaaah!"</b></span>, which roughly translates to:
    </p>

    <ul><li>"Human Kate! The offender has disobeyed me by aliving again, and so I have murdered it for the 978th time and brought it to you for a bounty of ear scratches."</li></ul>
